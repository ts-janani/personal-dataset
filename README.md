# personal-dataset
Motivation:
I wanted to answer various questions regarding school shootings across the United States, including what type of school is most susceptible, which state they occur in the most, and how many there have been overall. 

Data Process: 
I found the source data at https://www.kaggle.com/ecodan/school-shootings-us-1990present. The original dataset included the date, city, state, area type (urban, suburban, rural), the type of school, the number of fatalities, number of wounded, where the details of each incident was sourced (Wikipedia or the Pah/Amaral/Hagan research), and a short description of the incident. Firstly I cleaned the data, getting rid of the descriptions, area type as well as the wounded. These columns were only about half filled, so I felt they would not produce any solid overall data. I then deleted all the duplicate incidents, by idenitifying duplicate dates in Excel. Some of the data points had the school type missing, so I filled them in with "Unknown". The rest of data was well recorded with no typos, so this left me with my final dataset. 

•Visualization: The ReadMe should contain at least one visualization summarizing the data. The
visualizations should follow the principles of good figure design and be sufficiently documented to
explain what they are demonstrating.

I created a few 
•Analysis: Finally, the ReadMe should describe the results of at least one method from this course
that you applied to the dataset and what you learned from it. This can be anything from a simple EDA
technique like identifying outliers, making a box plot of a column, evaluating the summary statistics
(Tukey’s 5 numbers), to one of the regression models from supervised learning, or one of the clustering
methods from unsupervised learning. This is not an exhaustive list of possibilities and as with the
previous components doesn’t need to be long or drawn out.
